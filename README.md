# Traffic-Prediction
SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing and Prophet models were deployed in order to predict the vehicle volumes over time. Due to asynchronous collection and data sparsity at various junctions, this report focused on Junction 1. Lastly, holiday effects were modeled under the assumption that the data is from the United States, which may affect the accuracy of the results.
## Motivation
Traffic congestion is a rising global concern that negatively impacts countries globally. The widespread consequences include time loss, freight delays, exacerbated environmental impacts, increased fuel consumption, and a diminished quality of life. (INRIX, 2025) Accurate traffic prediction not only improves network capacity utilization but also helps alleviate congestion by empowering traffic management centers (TMCs) and road operators to control traffic more effectively.
